# Solved notebooks

The _solutions_ for the WordCount application can be found in this folder.

A _pre-rendered_ version can be found, in HTML format. You can use those without
the need to have a Jupyter Notebook running. The Notebook files (`.ipynb` extension)
are also available here. GitHub makes a nice job rendering the notebooks; this allows
to easily inspect them from within the browser.
